<h2>Text to Speech using AWS Polly and Boto3</h2>

<p>In this small project I would like to show a simple text to speech converter using the AWS Polly service and the boto3 python SDK for AWS.
<br>Before show you the development behind this small application I would like to take a moment to explain what is Amazon Polly and why we are using the boto3 python SDK.
<br>Amazon Polly is a service that turns text into lifelike speech, allowing you to create application that talk and design products that are speech-interactive and increase engagement and accessibility.
<br>Polly's text-to-speech (TTS) uses advance deep learning technologies to synthesize natural sounding human speech.
<br>Amazon Polly supports multiple languages and includes a variety of lifelike voices, so developers can build speech-enabled applications that work in multiple locations and use the ideal voice for their customers.
