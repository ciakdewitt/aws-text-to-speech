<h2>Text to Speech using AWS Polly and Boto3</h2>

<p>In this small project I would like to show a simple text to speech converter using the AWS Polly service and the boto3 python SDK for AWS.
<br>Before show you the development behind this small application I would like to take a moment to explain what is Amazon Polly and why we are using the boto3 python SDK.<br>
<br>Amazon Polly is a service that turns text into lifelike speech, allowing you to create application that talk and design products that are speech-interactive and increase engagement and accessibility.
<br>Polly's text-to-speech (TTS) uses advance deep learning technologies to synthesize natural sounding human speech.
<br>Amazon Polly supports multiple languages and includes a variety of lifelike voices, so developers can build speech-enabled applications that work in multiple locations and use the ideal voice for their customers.
<br>In addition to Standard TTS voices, Amazon Polly offers Neural Text-to-Speech(NTTS) voices that deliver advanced improvements in speech quality.<br>
<br>In this project we wont use the AWS Console, instead we will create our own GUI using Python tkinter and we will access the Polly service thanks to python boto3 SDK.<br>
<br>I wont go through the full code explanation, instead I will provide the code screen with all the comments in place.
